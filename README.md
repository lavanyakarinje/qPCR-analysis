# qPCR-analysis from Cq values

Takes excel file output from qPCR machine, sample names layout and optional standard curve parameters. Plots Cq data, absolute concentrations and Tms in a neat format, ~ almost ready for publication.
- Code works with .xlsx file output by `Applied Biosystems Quantstudio-3`)
- If you need to analyze data from other instruments and if the current code fails, export to RDML format and use the script `linregpcr_processing.R`

_standard curve_ : Include Stdxx (xx = numbering) in the excel file name to process data and make a standard curve using data within the file

*If you're wondering that you can do all this with your expert excel skills, here's my rationale to convince you*: Coding this trivial analysis and plotting is very useful because I run tons of qPCR and I want all the plots to have the same formatting for easy comparision of data between runs without clicking around for every analysis. I wouldn't want to plot all these on excel! The script is especially handy when I run some experiment in a hurry for a meeting and I can get something to show in 2 mins by running the script ðŸ˜‚

## Setup/pre-requisites
- If you haven't already, you need to install these things 
	- R (_the programming language_), 
	- Rstudio/Positron/any IDE (_GUI interface to run R and check results_) , 
	- git (_software that handles version control; ensures you can get any updates that I make_); 
	
- Install the R packages needed for this pipeline using the command below. These are the packages listed with the library commands in `0-general_functions_main.R` script (_which means the functions they contain are loaded into R for use_) or used within other sub-scripts with the `plyr::empty()` invocation where `plyr` is the package name and `empty()` the name of the function. _
```R
install.packages('pak') # download and install the package installer

# use pak to install the R packages listed in the text file
pak::pkg_install(readLines('dependancies.txt'))
```

## Setup of this pipeline/tool for qPCR analysis
1. Clone the respository using git onto your computer. This brings in the code files and also mimics the folder structure (check if all the necessary folders are present)
2. Open the scripts in R by clicking on the `qPCR analysis.Rproj` file. _This ensures that R's current working directory is at the base of this project. 
3. *Set metadata sheets*: Default option is to add your plate layout in the `excel files/Plate layout.xlsx` file. Make sure the `template_source` variable is set to *'excel'* in `0.5-user-inputs.R` file.
	- If you would prefer a cloud option, then make a googlesheet with sheets named `qPCR plate layouts` and `qPCR Std curves` following the template from [my sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RffyflHCQ_GzlRHbeH3bAkiYo4zNlnFWx4FXo7xkUt8/edit#gid=0)
	- Copy the url of your googlesheet and replace the one in `sheeturls = list(plate_layouts_PK = ..` in the script `0-general_functions_main.R`
4. Check that you have properly installed everything by running the test dataset `q50_S080..xlsx` (_coded by default; all inputs provided_). It should run everything and produce a `.html` output file that matches the `q50_expected_output.html`.	


## Day to day running (for new datasets) 
4. Enter your sample name details into the `Plate layouts` sheet in a format of your choice (_excel / googlesheets_)
	- Ensure that the format is maintained without any blank rows to avoid any issues with parsing the file and make sure C1 is filled with some text


5. Open `0.5-user-inputs.R` script. Change only the `flnm` variable (_for simple runs_). and other options by following the comments in the file
6. You can try running the template file `q50_S080_RAM 80a_mjd61 repression_new barcode` within the `excel files/` folder. Metadata for this is provided in the `Plate layouts.xlsx` sheet in the same folder, and this should be read by changing the `template_source <-` to `'excel'` in the user settings file `0.5-user_inputs.R`. _Side note: I read this from a google sheet that enables me to setup qPCRs by looking at this sheet on my phone :). Here is [my google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RffyflHCQ_GzlRHbeH3bAkiYo4zNlnFWx4FXo7xkUt8/edit#gid=0) with the metadata.
7. Open `analysis.R` script and source it to analyze the data. 


**Sample naming scheme**
Sample names are written in a google sheet (contact me for access to see the template) in this particular format
`targetname_samplecategory_templatename` with an optional `_biologicalreplicatenumber` in the end
- targetname = name of the amplicon, _ex: 16S, U64, spliced_. _When plotting, each target is shown in a separate facet using `facet_grid()`
- samplecategory could stand for test, positive, negative (controls) or NoRT control etc. _This will be used to colour data in the plot_
- templatename = name of the DNA or RNA sample loaded as the template. _this appears on the x/y axes of the plot_
- biologicalreplicatenumber = 1,2,3 .. _If not provided, the code makes it in a rowwise order. This is useful to plot all replicates in the same template location and plot averages of the replicates_
Examples: _16S_negative_MG1655_ or _16S_Maximal_AOS109_

The output image looks like this
- `targetname` becomes facets or panels (boxes on the top); 
- samplecategory as colour (named as `Sample_name`)
- `templatename` on the x axis (named `assay_variable` in the code) and

**Code organization**

1. *main* branch holds the latest version of the code for general purpose plotting for any qPCR output file with sample names in the above way
2. For customized plots for individual experiments, you can process the data with the regular script and then code custom `.R` scripts to rename data and re-plot the data in your own way. Scripts of this kind that I used for my experiments are in the `adhoc_scripts/` folder.
3. The main


# qPCR analysis using LinRegPCR

Linregpcr tool analyzes raw qPCR curves and calculates the ~initial fluorescence which can be converted into initial concentration using calibration standards (6 replicates of the same concentration known standard). I have made a wrapper to run their python version of LinRegPCR through R, but the portability and documentation is in progress.

If you want to try it out, the script is called `linregpcr_processing.R`

## How does LinRegPCR work?

**Summary**: The linregPCR method is more robust and open source compared to proprietary methods used by vendor software. This works with curves that have a reasonable baseline and plateau region with good plateau intensity above baseline. This could be problematic for probe based data, or samples with very high (ex: 16S) or very low quantifications, so iterate and decide for yourself if this is right for you. 
- LinRegPCR outputs both efficiency and Cq values which are used for quantification. Absolute quantification can be done using calibration with a single concentration of known concentration sample x 6 replicates
